# Block-Destroyer-Mobile
## About ##
- A mobile remastered version of my original Block Destroyer game.
- Destroy blokcs by bouncing the ball of the paddle.

## Touch Controls ##
- Press/Release to launch the ball
- Slide to move paddle across screen

## Game Mechanics ##
- Each level is procedurally generated so that the blocks appear random each time, thus increasing the replay value.
- When all the blocks are destroyed, a count down timer will start signalling the next wave of blocks to generate.
